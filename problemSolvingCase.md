To solve the issue of overlapping time-pff categories, we can follow below approaches:
## Solution Approach

### Approach 1 - Add a Special "is_work_remotely" Flag to Time_off_request

#### Description 
- Add a new column to the Time_off_request table to indicate if the request is for "Work Remotely". This could be a boolean column like is_work_remotely.
- When creating or updating a request, the application checks this flag to determine if overlapping is allowed. 

#### Pros:
- Easy to understand and maintain as for each category we know if it can be overlapped with work from home.
- Gives flexibility to change the overlap without changing business logic.
#### Cons:
- Would not work for leaves where we want overlap but work from home is not the one in subject.

### Approach 2 - Allow Specific Overlapping Categories via Business Logic
#### Description
- Adjust the business logic in the backend to allow certain categories to overlap while preventing other categories from overlapping.
- The application checks if the new request overlaps with an existing one. If it does, the application checks whether both categories are allowed to overlap (e.g., "Work Remotely" and "Annual Leave").

#### Pros:
- Easy to implement in the existing application logic without modifying the database schema.
- Provides flexibility to define and change which categories can overlap.

#### Cons:
- Logic might get complex if there are many categories with varying overlap categories.
- Not enforced at the database level, so errors could still occur if requests are made outside the application.

### Approach 3 - Having "Overlapping categories" in a Separate Database Table
#### Description:
- Create a new table `Category_Overlap` with columns category_id_1, category_id_2, and is_allowed to explicitly define which category pairs are allowed to overlap.
- Whenever a new request is made, the backend checks this table to determine if the overlap is allowed.

#### Pros:
- Offers a clean, flexible, and easily maintainable solution.
- Centralizes the overlap categories in one table, making them easy to manage and change.
- Can be used to build a dynamic user interface that reflects allowed overlaps.

#### Cons:
- Requires modification to the database schema.
- Slightly more complex to implement initially, as it requires changes in both the application logic and the database schema.

### Recommendation: 

| Approach               | Recommendation on when to use                                                            |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. "is_work_remotely" Flag | When the use case is only to check overlapping between "Work Remotely" and other categories |
| 2. Business Logic Check | Suitable for a quick fix or small-scale use with limited categories                       |
| 3. Overlap Categories Table | When overlapping categories are dynamic and frequently changing                         |

##### Approach 3 is the best solution because
1. Provides a flexible way to define and manage overlapping categories.
2. Can easily extend to new categories
3. Allows for efficient checks in the application logic while keeping the data schema clear and organized.
4. Even for small scale the over head of maintenance is less.
